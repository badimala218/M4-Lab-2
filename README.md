### Notes
- It will load the inital set of employees if the localStorage array is empty.  This is for testing purposes to prove it loads.

- *No Delete Buttons.* The write-up didn't mention adding delete buttons, so it will ask for delete confirmation if you *click on the row.*

- Delete confirmation uses the employee ID.

- I'm not sure why but the rowIndex property for <tr> is one-off a zero-based indexing.
